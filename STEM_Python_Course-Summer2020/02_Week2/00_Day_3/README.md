### Day 3 (Cython Tutorials)

Some of these tutorials require a C++ and Fortran compiler. On most linux distributions gcc/g++/gfortran (GNU Compiler Collection) should already be installed. To check this run `gcc --version` in a terminal. On MacOS you can check that you have a C compiler with `clang --version`. The clang/clang++ compiler can be installed by running the command `xcode-select --install` in a terminal or though the xcode app. For Fortran code gfortran can be installed though the gcc package on [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), `brew install gcc`.

### Morning Session:
- Multiprocessing
- Cython to speed up code
- Cython to integrate C/C++
- Cython to integrate Fortran


### Afternoon Session:
- Complete the tasks for Day 1 and Day 2.
- Use Cython to speed up the code examples.
- Work on your own code you'd like to speedup or integrate C/C++/Fortran with.
