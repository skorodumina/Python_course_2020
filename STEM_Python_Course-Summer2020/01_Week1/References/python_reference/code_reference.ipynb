    "**Opening files**: `open()` returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: `open(filename, mode)`\n",
    "- The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be `r` when the file will only be read, `w` for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and `a` opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. `r+` opens the file for both reading and writing. The mode argument is *optional*; `r` will be assumed if it’s omitted.\n",
    "- You should call `f.close()` or a `with` statement to close the file at the end of your program to immediately free up any system resources used by it. If you don’t explicitly close a file, Python’s garbage collector will eventually destroy the object and close the open file for you, but the file may stay open for a while. Another risk is that different Python implementations will do this clean-up at different times.\n",
    "- Normally, files are opened in text mode, meaning that you read and write strings from and to the file, which are encoded in a specific encoding. If encoding is not specified, the default is platform dependent (see `open()`). `b` appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode: now the data is read and written in the form of bytes objects. This mode should be used for all files that don’t contain text.\n",
    "    + In text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-specific line endings (`\\n` on Unix, `\\r\\n` on Windows) to just `\\n`. When writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of `\\n` back to platform-specific line endings. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for text files, but will corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE files. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and writing such files."
